# Dangerous Goods Counting
This demo app helps me categorize and count all confiscated items in the Aviation Police Bureau.

## Background
All confiscated items (dangerous or hazardous) are categorized into 12 groups:
* Scissors and Knifes (刀剪)
* Tripods (腳架)
* Sticks and Rods (棍棒)
* Tools (工具)
* Lighters (打火機)
* Lead-Acid and Lithinium Batteries (鉛酸/鋰電池)
* Toy Guns or Swords (槍刀玩具)
* Sprays (噴罐)
* Pepper Sprays (防狼噴霧)
* Fireworks (煙火)
* Inflammable Liquid (易燃液體)
* Corrosive Liquids (腐蝕液體)

## Implemented
* Counting
  * Input a count to a group; the count should be positive
  * Increment/Decrement the count of a group
  * Reset all counts
* Summary
  * Total of all counts
* Save/Load
  * All counts are saved into HTML5 local storage

## Planning 

* Double-click a group to add count to it
* Tabs to switch between Terminals 1 and 2
* Better UI
